@tomaitken/ckeditor5-footnotes
==============================

This package was created by the [ckeditor5-package-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor5-package-generator) package. It is essentially lifted from the [ForumMagnum Footnote Plugin](https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum/tree/master/public/lesswrong-editor/src/ckeditor5-footnote/src) with only minor modifications. All intellectual credit should go to the developers of this plugin.

## Usage
Install via NPM / yarn.

Then import code and CSS:
```
import '@tomaitken/ckeditor5-footnotes/index.css';

import { Footnotes } from '@tomaitken/ckeditor5-footnotes';
```

Then add this `Footnotes` import to the plugins list and the string `'footnote'` to the toolbar buttons.

## Developing the package

To read about the CKEditor 5 Framework, visit the [CKEditor 5 Framework documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/index.html).

## Available scripts

NPM scripts are a convenient way to provide commands in a project. They are defined in the `package.json` file and shared with people contributing to the project. It ensures developers use the same command with the same options (flags).

All the scripts can be executed by running `yarn run <script>`. Pre and post commands with matching names will be run for those as well.

The following scripts are available in the package.

### `start`

Starts an HTTP server with the live-reload mechanism that allows previewing and testing of plugins available in the package.

When the server starts, the default browser will open the developer sample. This can be disabled by passing the `--no-open` option to that command.

You can also define the language that will translate the created editor by specifying the `--language [LANG]` option. It defaults to `'en'`.

Examples:

```bash
# Starts the server and open the browser.
yarn run start

# Disable auto-opening the browser.
yarn run start --no-open

# Create the editor with the interface in German.
yarn run start --language=de
```

### ~`test`~

There are no tests for this plugin! Too lazy!


### `lint`

Runs ESLint, which analyzes the code (all `*.ts` files) to quickly find problems.

Examples:

```bash
# Execute eslint.
yarn run lint
```

### `stylelint`

Similar to the `lint` task, stylelint analyzes the CSS code (`*.css` files in the `theme/` directory) in the package.

Examples:

```bash
# Execute stylelint.
yarn run stylelint
```

### `build:dist`

Creates npm and browser builds of your plugin. These builds can be added to the editor by following the [Configuring CKEditor 5 features](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/setup/configuration.html) guide.

Examples:

```bash
# Builds the `npm` and browser files thats are ready to publish.
npm run build:dist
```

### `translations:collect`

Collects translation messages (arguments of the `t()` function) and context files, then validates whether the provided values do not interfere with the values specified in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` package.

The task may end with an error if one of the following conditions is met:

* Found the `Unused context` error &ndash; entries specified in the `lang/contexts.json` file are not used in source files. They should be removed.
* Found the `Context is duplicated for the id` error &ndash; some of the entries are duplicated. Consider removing them from the `lang/contexts.json` file, or rewrite them.
* Found the `Context for the message id is missing` error &ndash; entries specified in source files are not described in the `lang/contexts.json` file. They should be added.

Examples:

```bash
yarn run translations:collect
```

### `translations:download`

Download translations from the Transifex server. Depending on users' activity in the project, it creates translation files used for building the editor.

The task requires passing the URL to Transifex API. Usually, it matches the following format: `https://www.transifex.com/api/2/project/[PROJECT_SLUG]`.

To avoid passing the `--transifex` option whenever you call the command, you can store it in `package.json`, next to the `ckeditor5-package-tools translations:download` command.

Examples:

```bash
yarn run translations:download --transifex [API URL]
```

### `translations:upload`

Uploads translation messages onto the Transifex server. It allows users to create translations into other languages using the Transifex platform.

The task requires passing the URL to the Transifex API. Usually, it matches the following format: `https://www.transifex.com/api/2/project/[PROJECT_SLUG]`.

To avoid passing the `--transifex` option whenever you call the command, you can store it in `package.json`, next to the `ckeditor5-package-tools translations:upload` command.

Examples:

```bash
yarn run translations:upload --transifex [API URL]
```

### `ts:build` and `ts:clear`

These scripts compile TypeScript and remove the compiled files. They are used in the aforementioned life cycle scripts, and there is no need to call them manually.
